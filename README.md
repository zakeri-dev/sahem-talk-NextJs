# Installation üìñ

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nextjs-ollama-llm-ui.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nextjs-ollama-llm-ui/versions)

Use a pre-build package from one of the supported package managers to run a local environment of the web interface.
Alternatively you can install from source with the instructions below.

> [!NOTE]  
> If your frontend runs on something other than `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`, you'll need to set the OLLAMA_ORIGINS to your frontend url.
>
> This is also stated in the [documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server):
